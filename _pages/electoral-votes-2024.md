## About Electoral Votes 2024

While most states follow a winner-take-all rule for electoral votes, Maine and Nebraska also split some of their votes by congressional district, [according to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College). Currently in 2024 in Maine, 2 electoral votes are awarded to the statewide winner, plus 1 vote in each of their 2 congressional districts, for a total of 4. In the more populated state of Nebraska, 2 electoral votes are awarded to the statewide winner, plus 1 vote in each of their 3 congressional districts, for a total of 5.

How you enter these results into a Datawrapper choropleth map depends on the type of electoral map background you choose. In the *USA > Electoral College 2024 (conventional) background map*, the congressional district (CD) votes for Maine (ME) and Nebraska (NE) must be shown together, even if they are split between different candidates. In the hypothetical scenario below, the 3 Nebraska Congressional District votes (NECD) were split between candidates X & Y, which you should represent with a different color (typically purple) than states won by only one candidate (typically red or blue).

  | State | Votes | Winner |
  |-------|-------|--------|
  | ME    | 2     | X      |
  | MECD  | 2     | X      |
  | NE    | 2     | Y      |
  | NECD  | 3     | X & Y  |   

By contrast, in the *USA > Electoral College 2024 (hexagons) background map*, electoral votes appear separately for each statewide winner and congressional district, so you can enter those results on separate lines and represent them with standard colors (typically red or blue).

  | State | Votes | Winner |
  |-------|-------|--------|
  | ME    | 2     | X      |
  | MECD1 | 1     | X      |
  | MECD2 | 1     | X      |
  | NE    | 2     | Y      |
  | NECD1 | 1     | X      |
  | NECD2 | 1     | Y      |
  | NECD3 | 1     | Y      |
