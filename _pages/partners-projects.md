## Fall 2024
### Affordable Homeownership

Our community partner, the [Center for Leadership and Justice](https://cljct.org), asked us to answer questions about their [Urban Suburban Affordables, Inc.](https://cljct.org/what-we-do/housing-initiatives/) (USA) community land trust program, launched in the mid-1990s as a strategy to maintain affordable homeownership. CLJ provided a list of 211 USA homes across the Hartford region, purchased by low-to-middle income buyers, while the community trust owns the land and sets the maximum resale price to maintain affordability for the next generation. Trinity student authors focused on specific questions, then collected, analyzed, and visualized their findings in data stories below. We report coded or aggregated findings because we agreed not to publish individual addresses to maintain homeowner privacy.

### Child Care and College Access

For our **Child Care** projects, Izzi Greenberg, Executive Director of [Middlesex Coalition for Children](https://www.middlesexchildren.org) and Merrill Gay, Executive Director of [CT Early Childhood Alliance](http://earlychildhoodalliance.com) asked us to help visualize answers to this broad question: How and why does child care availability, affordability, and quality vary across Connecticut, and what can we learn from improvement strategies outside the state?

### Food Scrap Pilot Program
Former DataViz student Shayla Whitaker earned a Community Learning Research Fellowship to collaborate with two community partners on this Fall 2023 project:

[Visualizing Connecticut Food Scrap Pilot Programs: Representation, Participation, and Benefits](https://datavizforall.org/whitaker/), by Shayla Whitaker, Community Learning Research Fellow, [Center for Hartford Engagement and Research](https://www.trincoll.edu/cher/) (CHER) at Trinity College, with community partners: CT Dept. of Energy and Environmental Protection (CT DEEP) and the Center for Leadership and Justice (CLJ).

Abstract: We are in a trash crisis. A large portion of waste that goes to incinerators and landfills is food scraps, one of the heaviest types of waste and one of the largest sources of methane. In 2022-23, the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (CT DEEP) awarded Sustainable Materials Management grants to fund food scraps pilot programs by local governments to divert food scraps from the waste stream. Studying questions about representation, participation, and benefits of these programs gives us a better understanding of their strengths and weaknesses and potential implementation at a larger scale. Among 15 grant awards across the state, data collected from West Hartford and Stonington showed these two pilot programs represented wealthier and whiter areas, an average 46 percent participation rate (for West Hartford), and food scrap diversion rates ranging from 5 to 17 percent. Policy recommendations: DEEP should require towns to collect more uniform data, and make it accessible for the public to learn from these pilot programs.

## Spring 2023
### Crash (with City of Hartford) and Trash (with Center for Leadership and Justice)

For our **Crash projects**, Grace Yi (Senior Planner, Bike & Ped) and Owen Deutsch (Principal Planner), from the [Planning Division, City of Hartford](https://www.hartfordct.gov/Government/Departments/DDS/DDS-Staff-Directory), asked us to help visualize answers to this question: When and where are the highest frequency of motor vehicle crash injuries and fatalities in Hartford, and what can we learn about traffic-calming measures?

### Parkville Neighborhood
Former DataViz student and TA Victoria Asfalg '23 collaborated with Hartford community partner and Clark University graduate student Zoe Chatfield on this Spring 2023 data story, [Parkville's Property: Who Influences Development? A Case Study on a Hartford, CT Neighborhood](https://datavizforall.org/parkville-asfalg/), which features several interactive maps and charts, built on City of Hartford property assessor data.

Abstract: Walking through Parkville today, you might be drawn to Parkville Market, Connecticut’s first food hall, with a variety of scents and flavors from cuisines around the world. Or you might notice Gather55, a pay-what-you-can restaurant serving up meals prepared by professional chefs. Or maybe your attention will be caught by the Curioporium, a museum-esque store full of oddities and legends. But what you might not know about these businesses, unless you have lived in Hartford for a while, is that all of them are less than a decade old. In the past 20 years or so, Hartford's Parkville neighborhood has seen significant change. I sat down with Clark University Master's student Zoe Chatfield to further discuss the change that is happening in Parkville. Her thesis is on how Hartford’s housing has shaped Parkville. We wondered, who is behind this change? What are their intentions? To answer these questions in a meaningful way, I decided to create a data story with original visualizations that would supplement Zoe's thesis. The broad goal of this data story is to answer these questions: How has the housing landscape of Parkville changed? How has commercial development in Parkville changed? Who influences development in Parkville? and, more importantly, What are their visions and goals for this neighborhood? Are these visions and goals being met?

## Fall 2022
### Center for Leadership and Justice (CLJ) and Education Funding Inequities
Our partners at [CLJ](https://cljct.org) asked us to help them analyze and visualize student residency and school district funding for their Greater Hartford Interfaith Action Alliance (GHIAA) Education Research team. We defined the metro Hartford area as a contiguous 33-town region, which includes 38 public school districts when counting magnets and charters. Also, we appreciate expert guidance on Connecticut education funding provided by the [School + State Finance Project](https://schoolstatefinance.org).

### Sheff v O'Neill 2022 School Integration Settlement
Since several students who completed the DataViz For All course later enrolled in my [Educ 308: Cities Suburbs and Schools course](https://jackdougherty.org/educ308), we worked together on another community-learning partnership. Our mission was to communicate the goals of the January 2022 Sheff v. O'Neill school integration settlement to broad audiences. Students designed and revised [five data visualizations](https://datavizforall.org/sheff-2022/) based on feedback collected from individual members of the Sheff Movement, and published final versions in this [May 2022 story by Jacqueline Rabe Thomas for CT Public Investigative News](https://www.ctpublic.org/news/investigative/2022-05-11/trinity-college-students-analysis-finds-state-far-from-promises-made-to-desegregate-hartford-schools).

## January 2022
### CT Coalition Against Domestic Violence (CCADV)
Our partners at [CCADV](https://ctcadv.org) asked us to help them analyze and visualize the first two years of de-identified data from [CTSafeConnect.com](https://ctsafeconnect.com), a new statewide hotline for people requesting help regarding intimate partner violence. To protect confidentiality, CCADV created a masked dataset with 50,000 rows of individual contacts between clients and staff, which we masked further by aggregating into 15 regions that resemble local service areas for use in students' data stories.
