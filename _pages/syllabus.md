## Fall 2024 Syllabus
Our course meets in-person on Mondays and Wednesdays 11:30am-12:45pm in CLASSROOM TBA at Trinity College, Hartford.

### Instructors
Professor Jack Dougherty, Trinity College, Hartford CT. [Email me a quick question](mailto:jack.dougherty@trincoll.edu) or [schedule a Zoom appointment on my calendar](https://jackdougherty.youcanbook.me).

Teaching Assistant Nellie Conklin - contact and scheduling info on Moodle

Course description: How can charts and maps tell meaningful stories? How can they mislead us from the truth? In this introductory hands-on course, we will create data visualizations in order to better understand design principles and develop a critical analysis of the field. Students will learn skills in both quantitative reasoning and digital storytelling as we advance from beginner tools to editing code templates. For the community learning component, our class will build interactive charts and maps on a public policy issue with a Hartford-area partner organization. No coding experience is necessary, but curiosity is required.     
- Fulfills Numerical and Symbolic Reasoning (NUM) requirement.   
- Cross-referenced with Community Learning, Public Policy & Law, Writing & Rhetoric, Urban Studies.  
- Enrollment limited to 19 students.  

### Community Learning Projects
Our project topic and Hartford-area community learning parter this semester:

**Affordable Homeownership:** Cori Mackey, Tieasha Gayle, and Bea Santiago of the [Center for Leadership and Justice](https://cljct.org) and its [Urban Suburban Affordables, Inc.](https://cljct.org/what-we-do/housing-initiatives/) (USA) community land trust. See [history of this homeownership program](https://cljct.org/history-of-homeownership-initiatives/). The CLJ has asked us to help visualize answers to these broad questions:
1. Where are USA community land trust homes located in the Hartford region, and in what types of neighborhoods?
2. How has USA homeownership and initial buyer price changed over time?
3. How much homeownership wealth has been created by the USA program?
4. How do USA homes measure up to block/neighborhood comparison groups (comps)?
5. How does the USA program compare with other community land trusts for affordable homeownership across Connecticut and the nation?

- Two open-access books are freely available online (or you can purchase print editions).
  - Jack Dougherty and Ilya Ilyankou, *Hands-On Data Visualization: Interactive Storytelling from Spreadsheets to Code* (O’Reilly Media, Inc., 2021), <https://HandsOnDataViz.org>.
  - Catherine D’Ignazio and Lauren F. Klein, *Data Feminism* (MIT Press, 2020), <https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu>.
- Bring a laptop computer (Mac, Windows, or Chromebook) to every class. Install more than one browser (such as Firefox, Safari, Chrome) for testing purposes. Tell me if you need a temporary laptop loaner.
- You will need to sign up for several free web services (such as Google Drive, Datawrapper, GitHub). See my list of [recommended free digital tools in this course](https://handsondataviz.org/recommended-tools.html).

### Learning Goals and Assessments
In this course you will demonstrate the knowledge and skills you have developed to meet 12 broad learning goals (with more specific sub-goals listed in the schedule further below):

1. Strengthen Your Spreadsheet Skills
2. Find and Question Your Data
3. Clean Up Messy Data
4. Make Meaningful Comparisons
5. Chart Your Data
6. Map Your Data
7. Transform Your Map Data
8. Edit and Host Leaflet Code on GitHub
9. Explore Leaflet Map Code Templates
10. Embed on the Web
11. Tell and Show Your Data Story
12. Detect Lies and Reduce Bias

Your progress toward these learning goals will be assessed in three ways:

#### A. Open-Book Weekly Quizzes
- The purpose is to demonstrate your knowledge and skills through questions that emphasize conceptual understanding and how to apply it in new contexts. You will have more than one opportunity to successfully complete each quiz while working independently with your notes, readings, and any web resources.
- Each week, select any 2-hour period during the quiz window (typically a four-day window from Wednesday afternoon to Sunday 9pm) to complete a Moodle quiz of around 5 questions on the designated learning goal. You may see different versions of questions than other students, but all questions address the same goal.
- Students can make at least two quiz attempts during the typical four-day window. Short-answer questions will be scored automatically by the computer, and show-your-work questions will be scored manually by the instructor. If you respond incorrectly to an auto-scored question, the quiz will offer advice and allow you to try again. If you respond incorrectly to a manually-scored question, the instructor will offer advice via email or a meeting and allow you to try again before the quiz window closes, if sufficient time remains.
- HINT: Start your quiz by Friday 1pm if you want to receive the instructor's feedback on show-your-work questions before the quiz window typically closes on Sunday 9pm. If you wait until the last minute and don't start your quiz until Saturday or Sunday, you may not receive feedback from the instructor in time.
- Before you start the quiz, prepare by reading assigned chapters, doing practice exercises, and discussing the material with classmates who have not yet started it.
- When you start the typical 2-hour quiz period, you may use your materials (including your notes, the online book, and any content on the Internet), but you must work independently and you may not communicate about the quiz content in any way (except with the instructors) until the quiz has closed. See the Intellectual Honesty policy further below.
- If you do not begin a quiz or demonstrate sufficient effort during the quiz window, a 20 percent late penalty will be deducted for every 12-hour period beyond the deadline. Exceptions are granted only for documented health or family emergencies.
- 12 broad learning goals x 5 points per quiz = 60 points

#### B. Building Data Stories
- The purpose is to show your original work in building different stages of data visualizations and written narratives that explain why and how it matters to our community partners. See the Intellectual Honesty policy below.
- Depending on the stage of the build, your work will be evaluated by the instructor, your peers, or guest experts, based on a rubric.
- 7 stages x 5 points = 35 points. A 20 percent late penalty will be deducted for every 12-hour period beyond the deadline. Exceptions are granted only for documented health or family emergencies.

#### C. Class Participation
- The purpose is to encourage active learning and accountability. Each student begins the course with 5 participation points. During class, you may be randomly called on to discuss a concept in our reading, or to share your computer screen for everyone to view while we learn tools and build data stories. You do not necessarily need to know the correct answer. But if you are not present or not able to participate when called, one point will be deducted each time from your participation score.
- Exceptions will be granted for health or family emergencies, or any scheduling conflicts (such as religious observances or other pre-planned events), if you email me in advance at least one hour before class (or at least one week before pre-planned events). If you have health concerns that prevent you from attending class in person (such as Covid), email me at least one hour before class to request permission to participate remotely via Zoom, which is not as good as attending in person, but better than not attending at all. Last-minute requests will not be granted.

#### Summary  
60 points quizzes + 35 points data stories + 5 class participation = 100 total points. In this course, unsatisfactory work (below 70%) falls in the D or F range, adequate work (70-79%) in the C range, good work (80-89%) in the B range, and outstanding work (90 to 100%) in the A range. Each range is divided into equal thirds for minus (-), regular, and plus (+) letter grades. For example, 80 to 83.33% = B-, 83.34 to 86.67 = B, and 86.68 to 89.99 = B+. Access your individual assessments on the password-protected Moodle site for this course at <https://moodle.trincoll.edu>.

#### Intellectual Honesty
- You are responsible for following the Intellectual Honesty policy as described in the [Trinity Student Handbook](https://www.trincoll.edu/policies/).
- For online quizzes, you may use your materials (including your notes, the online book, and any content on the Internet), but you must work independently and you may not communicate about the quiz content in any way (except with the instructors) until the quiz has closed. If doubts arise, the instructor may require you to retake a quiz under direct supervision and/or refer a case to the Honor Council.
- For build assignments, You (and your partner) are expected to create all original content (text and visualizations), with proper citations to any paraphrased or quoted text written by others, and image credits to any visuals produced by others. If any doubts arise, the instructor may require ask you to independently reproduce content under direct supervision and/or refer a case to the Honor Council.

#### Academic accommodations
Please notify me before our third class session, and [schedule an appointment on my calendar](https://jackdougherty.youcanbook.me) to discuss how we will implement your approved plan. For those students with accommodations approved after the start of the semester, a minimum of 10 days’ notice is required. Learn more at the [Student Accessibility Resource Center](https://www.trincoll.edu/sarc/).

### How to Succeed in this Course
- Bookmark this online syllabus and check it for important updates, which will appear **in bold**.
- Keep a calendar (paper or digital) to manage your time and meet deadlines.
- Bring a laptop (with a fully-charged battery) to every class, and turn off distractions to help you (and others) focus on learning. Set notifications on digital devices to "Do Not Disturb."
- Use a password manager to keep track of your digital accounts. See my [introduction to Bitwarden](https://handsondataviz.org/password-manager.html), an open-source password manager with free core features for Windows/Mac/Linux computers, all major web browsers, and iOS and Android mobile devices.
- Take initiative and ask questions: during or after class, via email, or by appointment [on my calendar](https://jackdougherty.youcanbook.me). If you don't understand something, other students probably are puzzled, too. Go ahead and ask.
- Meet up with other students outside of class. Create a small study group to review the course material and work together. The secret to success in college is teaching yourselves how to learn new material.
- If anything is interfering with your learning, email or talk with me. I care about how you're doing in life, not just in our classroom.

- Before class: Make any revisions you wish to your [Build 5 drafts](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Os3Q0J2zPRtkNCeUv2giNeOTlV1tKEAn3-XAuusPfa8/edit), and make sure they are shared for anyone to *comment*
- In-class: [Peer review assignments](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Os3Q0J2zPRtkNCeUv2giNeOTlV1tKEAn3-XAuusPfa8/edit) with [evaluation criteria](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Glp23sUrATB129wDvYx8YR7sd0qdLt-XqksOCfjLLVo/edit), due during class, for participation credit. Students must submit a full draft in order to participate in the peer review. Choose to either type comments into a shared Google Doc **or** hand-write on paper. Share copy with instructor who will evaluate the quality of constructive feedback.
- Assign [Build 6: Data Stories for Community Partners](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OSRcSDb3Hs6U2T-q50URzOmp93OhUW0ALu23P20T5yk/edit). Improve draft based on feedback, and migrate all content from Google Doc to GitHub Pages format, due Monday Dec 4th 2pm for instructor to forward to partners (for non-graded comments and participation credit).
- Tip: An efficient method to edit your data story on your computer:
  - In GitHub, download your `index.html` file to your computer
  - Use a text editor tool (not MS Word) to edit downloaded `index.html`. For example, [Pulsar](https://pulsar-edit.dev) is my favorite open-source text editor.
  - While using text editor to revise and save changes to your computer, simultaneously view how they appear in your browser with File > Open File > downloaded `index.html`. Since this version is temporarily stored on your local computer, your browser bar will display its location in a local format `file:///...` rather than the online format `https://...`
  - After editing, upload your newer `index.html` file from your computer to replace the older version on GitHub. OR copy and paste the contents of the newer version in place of the older contents on GitHub.
- Tip: Avoid deleting important HTML formatting in your data story template [like this common mistake](https://datavizforall.org/images/common-template-error.png)
