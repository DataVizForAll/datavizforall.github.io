## Fall 2024 Syllabus
Our course meets in-person on Mondays and Wednesdays 11:30am-12:45pm in Library B02 (basement level, first room near the stairwell) at Trinity College, Hartford.

### Instructors
Professor Jack Dougherty, Trinity College, Hartford CT. [Email me a quick question](mailto:jack.dougherty@trincoll.edu) or [schedule a Zoom appointment on my calendar](https://jackdougherty.youcanbook.me).

Teaching Assistant Nellie Conklin - contact and scheduling info on Moodle

Course description: How can charts and maps tell meaningful stories? How can they mislead us from the truth? In this introductory hands-on course, we will create data visualizations in order to better understand design principles and develop a critical analysis of the field. Students will learn skills in both quantitative reasoning and digital storytelling as we advance from beginner tools to editing code templates. For the community learning component, our class will build interactive charts and maps on a public policy issue with a Hartford-area partner organization. No coding experience is necessary, but curiosity is required.     
- Fulfills Numerical and Symbolic Reasoning (NUM) requirement.   
- Cross-referenced with Community Learning, Public Policy & Law, Writing & Rhetoric, Urban Studies.  
- Enrollment limited to 19 students.  

### Community Learning Project
Our project and Hartford-area community learning partners this semester:    
**Affordable Homeownership:** Cori Mackey, Tieasha Gayle, and Bea Santiago of the [Center for Leadership and Justice](https://cljct.org) and its [Urban Suburban Affordables, Inc.](https://cljct.org/what-we-do/housing-initiatives/) (USA) community land trust. See [history of this homeownership program](https://cljct.org/history-of-homeownership-initiatives/). The CLJ has asked us to help visualize answers to these broad questions:
1. Where are USA community land trust homes located in the Hartford region, and in what types of neighborhoods?
2. How have USA homeownership trends and sales prices changed over time?
3. How much homeownership wealth has been created by the USA program?
4. How do USA homes measure up to block/neighborhood comparison groups (comps)?
5. How does the USA program compare with other community land trusts for affordable homeownership across Connecticut and the nation?

### Course Materials and Tools
![book covers](/images/covers-hodv-datafeminism.png)
- Two open-access books are freely available online (or you can purchase print editions).
  - Jack Dougherty and Ilya Ilyankou, *Hands-On Data Visualization: Interactive Storytelling from Spreadsheets to Code* (O’Reilly Media, Inc., 2021), <https://HandsOnDataViz.org>.
  - Catherine D’Ignazio and Lauren F. Klein, *Data Feminism* (MIT Press, 2020), <https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu>.
- Bring a laptop computer (Mac, Windows, or Chromebook) to every class. Install more than one browser (such as Firefox, Safari, Chrome) for testing purposes. Tell me if you need a temporary laptop loaner.
- You will need to sign up for several free web services (such as Google Drive, Datawrapper, GitHub). See my list of [recommended free digital tools in this course](https://handsondataviz.org/recommended-tools.html).

### Learning Goals and Assessments
In this course you will demonstrate the knowledge and skills you have developed to meet 12 broad learning goals (with more specific sub-goals listed in the schedule further below):

1. Strengthen Your Spreadsheet Skills
2. Find and Question Your Data
3. Clean Up Messy Data
4. Make Meaningful Comparisons
5. Chart Your Data
6. Map Your Data
7. Transform Your Map Data
8. Edit and Host Leaflet Code on GitHub
9. Detect Lies and Reduce Bias
10. Explore Leaflet Map Code Templates
11. Tell and Show Your Data Story
12. Embed on the Web

Your progress toward these learning goals will be assessed in three ways:

#### A. Open-Book Weekly Quizzes
- The purpose is to demonstrate your knowledge and skills through questions that emphasize conceptual understanding and how to apply it in new contexts. You will have more than one opportunity to successfully complete each quiz while working independently with your notes, readings, and any web resources.
- Each week, select any 2-hour period during the quiz window (typically a four-day window from Wednesday afternoon to Sunday 9pm) to complete a Moodle quiz of around 5 questions on the designated learning goal. You may see different versions of questions than other students, but all questions address the same goal.
- Students can make at least two quiz attempts during the typical four-day window. Short-answer questions will be scored automatically by the computer, and show-your-work questions will be scored manually by the instructor. If you respond incorrectly to an auto-scored question, the quiz will offer advice and allow you to try again. If you respond incorrectly to a manually-scored question, the instructor will offer advice via email or a meeting and allow you to try again before the quiz window closes, if sufficient time remains.
- HINT: Start your quiz by Friday 12 noon if you want to receive the instructor's feedback on show-your-work questions before the quiz window typically closes on Sunday 9pm. If you wait until the last minute and don't start your quiz until Saturday or Sunday, you may not receive feedback from the instructor in time to do a second attempt.
- Before you start the quiz, prepare by reading assigned chapters, doing practice exercises, and discussing the material with classmates who have not yet started it.
- When you start the typical 2-hour quiz period, you may use your materials (including your notes, the online book, and any Internet content or tools), but you must work independently and you may not communicate about the quiz content in any way (except with the instructors) until the quiz has closed. See the Intellectual Honesty and Artificial Intelligence policy further below.
- If you do not begin a quiz or demonstrate sufficient effort during the quiz window, a 20 percent late penalty will be deducted for every 12-hour period beyond the deadline. Exceptions are granted only for documented health or family emergencies.
- 12 learning goals x 5 points per quiz (but no quiz for Goal #11) = 55 points

#### B. Building Data Stories
- The purpose is to show your original work in building different stages of data visualizations and written narratives that explain why and how it matters to our community partners. See the Intellectual Honesty and Artificial Intelligence policy further below.
- Depending on the stage of the build, your work will be evaluated by the instructor, your peers, or guest experts, based on a rubric.
- 8 stages x 5 points = 40 points. A 20 percent late penalty will be deducted for every 12-hour period beyond the deadline, with exceptions granted only for documented health or family emergencies.

#### C. Class Participation
- The purpose is to encourage active learning and accountability. Each student begins the course with 5 participation points. During class, you may be randomly called on to discuss a concept in our reading, or to share your computer screen for everyone to view while we learn tools and build data stories. You do not necessarily need to know the correct answer. But if you are not present or not able to participate when called, one point will be deducted each time from your participation score.
- Exceptions will be granted for any pre-scheduled absences (such as religious observations or any pre-planned events, if you email me at least one week ahead of time), or health or family emergencies (if you email me at least one hour before class). If you have health concerns that prevent you from attending class in person (such as Covid or other illness), email me at least one hour before class, and if feasible, request permission to participate remotely. Learning on Zoom is not as good as learning in real life, but it's better than not attending at all. Last-minute requests will not be granted.

#### Summary  
55 points quizzes + 40 points data stories + 5 class participation = 100 total points. In this course, unsatisfactory work (below 70%) falls in the D or F range, adequate work (70-79%) in the C range, good work (80-89%) in the B range, and outstanding work (90 to 100%) in the A range. Each range is divided into equal thirds for minus (-), regular, and plus (+) letter grades. For example, 80 to 83.33% = B-, 83.34 to 86.67 = B, and 86.68 to 89.99 = B+. Access your individual assessments on the password-protected Moodle site for this course at <https://moodle.trincoll.edu>.

#### Intellectual Honesty and Artificial Intelligence
- You are responsible for following the Intellectual Honesty policy as described in the [Trinity Student Handbook](https://www.trincoll.edu/policies/).
- Artificial intelligence tools are not prohibited in this course, but think carefully before using *any* technology that might interfere with your learning. Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT by OpenAI or Claude by Anthropic, can be helpful for repetitive coding tasks or proofreading paragraphs you've already composed. But LLMs also create plausible-sounding text with invented facts and bad calculations. LLMs also raise ethical questions about unpaid labor, energy usage, harmful biases, and safety for humanity. Don't cheat yourself out of an education by substituting LLM-generated responses in place of authentic learning.
- For online quizzes, you may use your materials (including your notes, the online book, and any Internet content or tools), but you must work independently and you may not communicate about the quiz content in any way (except with the instructors) until the quiz has closed. If any doubts arise, the instructor may require you to show your work, retake a quiz under direct supervision, or refer a case to the Honor Council.
- For build assignments, You (and your partner) are expected to create all original content (text and visualizations), with proper citations to any paraphrased or quoted text written by others, image credits to any visuals produced by others, and a methods section that describes all tools used and how. If any doubts arise, the instructor may require you to show your work, or independently reproduce content under direct supervision, or refer a case to the Honor Council.

#### Academic accommodations
Please notify me before our third class session, and [schedule an appointment on my calendar](https://jackdougherty.youcanbook.me) to discuss how we will implement your approved plan. For those students with accommodations approved after the start of the semester, a minimum of 10 days’ notice is required. Learn more at the [Student Accessibility Resource Center](https://www.trincoll.edu/sarc/).

### How to Succeed in this Course
- Bookmark this online syllabus and check it for important updates, which will appear **in bold**.
- Keep a calendar (paper or digital) to manage your time and meet deadlines.
- Bring a laptop (with a fully-charged battery) to every class, and turn off distractions to help you (and others) focus on learning. Set notifications on digital devices to "Do Not Disturb."
- Use a password manager to keep track of your digital accounts. See my [introduction to Bitwarden](https://handsondataviz.org/password-manager.html), an open-source password manager with free core features for Windows/Mac/Linux computers, all major web browsers, and iOS and Android mobile devices.
- Take initiative and ask questions: during or after class, via email, or by appointment [on my calendar](https://jackdougherty.youcanbook.me). If you don't understand something, other students probably are puzzled, too. Go ahead and ask.
- Meet up with other students outside of class. Create a small study group to review the course material and work together. The secret to success in college is teaching yourselves how to learn new material.
- If anything is interfering with your learning, email or talk with me. I care about how you're doing in life, not just in our classroom.

Under the arrangement, USA owns the land and low to moderate-income residents became first time homeowners. There are 200 plus properties in the Greater Hartford area. Homeowners pay USA a “land lease fee” of $15-45 dollars a month. When the homeowner goes to sell, USA income qualifies the next buyer and sets the allowable sales price based on a formula provided by DOH many years ago.

### Wed Nov 20
<!-- - Let's support and coach each other to successfully complete our semester -->
- In-class: Assign peer reviews of Build 6 with evaluation criteria (TODO), due during class, for participation credit. Students must have submitted a full draft in order to participate in the peer review. Choose either to type comments into a shared Google Doc or hand-write on paper, and share a copy with the instructor, who will will evaluate the quality of your constructive feedback.
- Schedule 20-minute Zoom appointments [on my calendar](https://jackdougherty.org) for Monday Nov 25th or Tues Nov 26th. If working with a partner, be sure to share the appointment information, since both of you must attend the meeting at the same time to earn participation credit.
- Assign Build 7: Data Stories for Community Partners. Improve your draft based on instructor and peer feedback, and migrate all content from Google Doc to GitHub Pages format. Insert link to your published GitHub Pages template on our Build 7 doc. Due Monday Dec 2nd 9pm (the first day back from Thanksgiving break) for instructor to forward to community partners for non-graded comments, worth participation credit.
- Tip: An efficient method to edit your data story on your computer (TODO move this to a separate document)
  - In GitHub, download your `index.html` file to your computer
  - Use a text editor tool (not MS Word) to edit downloaded `index.html`. For example, [Pulsar](https://pulsar-edit.dev) is my favorite open-source text editor.
  - While using text editor to revise and save changes to your computer, simultaneously view how they appear in your browser with File > Open File > downloaded `index.html`. Since this version is temporarily stored on your local computer, your browser bar will display its location in a local format `file:///...` rather than the online format `https://...`
  - After editing, upload your newer `index.html` file from your computer to replace the older version on GitHub. OR copy and paste the contents of the newer version in place of the older contents on GitHub.
- Tip: Avoid deleting important HTML formatting in your data story template [like this common mistake](https://datavizforall.org/images/common-template-error.png)

### Mon Nov 25

- Insert your GitHub Pages data story links in the Build 7 Doc above, which you can continue to revise and republish until the deadline.
- Assign Build 8: Revise and Finalize Data story for guest experts. Your version is due Friday Dec 6th at 12 noon, with your published GitHub data story link inserted into the Build 8 document. There are **no extensions** because your data story will be "frozen" and a copy will be published on our public [Partners and Projects page](https://datavizforall.org/partners-projects/), and forwarded to our guest experts to read before your presentations. Worth 10 points, scored by guest experts.
- Decisions to make before your data story is "frozen" and published:
  - You can insert your full name (recommended), or you have the right to use only your first name or initials. Learn why in my chapter, "[Public Writing and Student Privacy](https://webwriting.trincoll.edu/chapter/dougherty-public/index.html)" in [Web Writing](https://webwriting.trincoll.edu) book (2015).
  - See what other students have done in [prior Partners and Projects](https://datavizforall.org/partners-projects/)
  - Recommended: Insert link to your published data story in your resume to demonstrate your skills and knowledge to prospective employers and graduate schools. See example (TODO)
- Keep in touch: See [my Advising page](https://jackdougherty.org/advising/) on "How to request a reference or recommendation letter"
- Rehearse your 1-minute presentations of Build 7 highlights for community partners. You will have more time for 2-minute presentations of Build 8 for guest experts.
