## Fall 2022 Syllabus
Our course meets in-person, wearing face masks in compliance with the [campus Covid policy](https://www.trincoll.edu/reopening/), on Tuesdays & Thursdays 1:30-2:45pm in Seabury S205 at Trinity College, Hartford.

### Instructors
Professor Jack Dougherty, Trinity College, Hartford CT. [Email me a quick question](mailto:jack.dougherty@trincoll.edu) or [schedule a Zoom appointment on my calendar](https://jackdougherty.youcanbook.me).

Teaching Assistant Victoria Asfalg '23

Course description: How can charts and maps tell meaningful stories? How can they mislead us from the truth? In this introductory hands-on course, we will create data visualizations in order to better understand design principles and develop a critical analysis of the field. Students will learn skills in both quantitative reasoning and digital storytelling as we advance from beginner tools to editing code templates. For the community learning component, our class will build interactive charts and maps on a public policy issue with a Hartford-area partner organization. No coding experience is necessary, but curiosity is required.     
- Fulfills Numerical and Symbolic Reasoning (NUM) requirement.   
- Cross-referenced with Community Learning, Public Policy & Law, Writing & Rhetoric, Urban Studies.  
- Enrollment limited to 19 students.  

### Community Learning Partner
Our partners at the [Center for Leadership and Justice](https://cljct.org) asked us to work with them to analyze and visualize data on education funding inequities in the metro Hartford region.

### Course Materials and Tools
![book covers](/images/covers-hodv-datafeminism.png)
- Two open-access books are freely available online (or you can purchase print editions).
  - Jack Dougherty and Ilya Ilyankou, *Hands-On Data Visualization: Interactive Storytelling from Spreadsheets to Code* (O’Reilly Media, Inc., 2021), <https://HandsOnDataViz.org>.
  - Catherine D’Ignazio and Lauren F. Klein, *Data Feminism* (MIT Press, 2020), <https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu>.
- Bring a laptop computer (Mac, Windows, or Chromebook) to every class. Install more than one browser (such as Firefox, Safari, Chrome) for testing purposes. Tell me if you need a temporary laptop loaner.
- You will need to sign up for several free web services (such as Google Drive, Datawrapper, GitHub). See my list of [recommended free digital tools in this course](https://handsondataviz.org/recommended-tools.html).

### Learning Goals and Assessments
In this course you will demonstrate the knowledge and skills you have developed to meet 12 broad learning goals (with more specific sub-goals listed in the schedule further below):

1. Strengthen Your Spreadsheet Skills
2. Find and Question Your Data
3. Clean Up Messy Data
4. Make Meaningful Comparisons
5. Chart Your Data
6. Map Your Data
7. Transform Your Map Data
8. Edit and Host Leaflet Code on GitHub
9. Explore Leaflet Map Code Templates
10. Tell and Show Your Data Story
11. Detect Lies and Reduce Bias
12. Embed on the Web

Your progress toward these learning goals will be assessed in three ways:

#### A. Open-Book Weekly Quizzes
- The purpose is to demonstrate your knowledge and skills through questions that emphasize conceptual understanding and how to apply it in new contexts. You will have more than one opportunity to successfully complete each quiz while working independently with your notes, readings, and any web resources.
- Each week, select any 2-hour period during the 3-day window (typically from Friday afternoon to Monday 9pm) to complete a Moodle quiz of around 5 questions on the designated learning goal. You may see different versions of questions than other students, but all questions address the same goal.
- Students have at least two attempts on every quiz. Short-answer questions will be scored automatically by the computer, and show-your-work questions will be scored manually by the instructor. If you respond incorrectly to an auto-scored question, the quiz will offer advice and allow you to try again. If you respond incorrectly to a manually-scored question, the instructor will offer advice via email or a meeting and allow you to try again within 24 hours.
- Before you start the quiz, prepare by reading assigned chapters, doing practice exercises, and discussing the material with classmates who have not yet started it.
- When you start the 2-hour quiz period, you may use your materials (including your notes, the online book, and the entire Internet), but you must work independently and you may not communicate about the quiz content in any way (except with the instructors) until the quiz has closed. You are responsible for following the Intellectual Honesty policy as described in the [Trinity Student Handbook](https://www.trincoll.edu/policies/). If doubts arise, the instructor may require you to retake a quiz under direct supervision and/or refer the issue to the Honor Council.
- If you do not begin a quiz or demonstrate sufficient effort during the initial quiz window, a 20 percent late penalty will be deducted for every 12-hour period beyond the deadline. Exceptions are granted only for documented health or family emergencies.
- 12 broad learning goals x 5 points per quiz = 60 points

#### B. Building Data Stories
- The purpose is to show your work in building different stages of data visualizations and written narratives that explain why and how it matters to our community partners.
- Depending on the stage of the build, your work will be evaluated by the instructor, your peers, or guest experts, based on a rubric.
- 7 stages x 5 points = 35 points. A 20 percent late penalty will be deducted for every 12-hour period beyond the deadline. Exceptions are granted only for documented health or family emergencies.

#### C. Class Participation
- The purpose is to encourage active learning and accountability. Each student begins the course with 5 participation points. During class, you may be randomly called on to discuss a concept in our reading, or to share your computer screen for everyone to view while we learn tools and build data stories. You do not necessarily need to know the correct answer. But if you are not present or not able to participate when called, a point will be deducted from your participation score. Exceptions are granted only for documented health or family emergencies, or scheduling conflicts where you have notified me well in advance.

**If you are quarantined or isolated due to Covid**, or if you have concerns about your health, contact me in advance to request permission to participate remotely via Zoom during a specific class session. Last-minute requests may not be granted permission.

#### Summary  
60 points quizzes + 35 points data stories + 5 class participation = 100 total points. In this course, unsatisfactory work (below 70%) falls in the D or F range, adequate work (70-79%) in the C range, good work (80-89%) in the B range, and outstanding work (90 to 100%) in the A range. Each range is divided into equal thirds for minus (-), regular, and plus (+) letter grades. For example, 80 to 83.33% = B-, 83.34 to 86.67 = B, and 86.68 to 89.99 = B+. Access your individual assessments on the password-protected Moodle site for this course at <https://moodle.trincoll.edu>.

Academic accommodations: please notify me before our third class session, and [schedule an appointment on my calendar](https://jackdougherty.youcanbook.me) to discuss how we will implement your approved plan. For those students with accommodations approved after the start of the semester, a minimum of 10 days’ notice is required. Learn more at the [Student Accessibility Resource Center](https://www.trincoll.edu/sarc/).

Religious observances or other advance scheduling conflicts: please notify me before our third class session to request accommodations. Do not ask me to address last-minute requests.

### How to Succeed in this Course
- Bookmark this online syllabus and check it for important updates, which will appear **in bold**.
- Keep a calendar (paper or digital) to manage your time and meet deadlines.
- Bring a laptop (with a fully-charged battery) to every class, and turn off distractions to help you (and others) focus on learning. Set notifications on digital devices to "Do Not Disturb."
- Use a password manager to keep track of your digital accounts. See my [introduction to Bitwarden](https://handsondataviz.org/password-manager.html), an open-source password manager with free core features for Windows/Mac/Linux computers, all major web browsers, and iOS and Android mobile devices.
- Take initiative and ask questions: during or after class, via email, or by appointment [on my calendar](https://jackdougherty.youcanbook.me). If you don't understand something, other students probably are puzzled, too. Go ahead and ask.
- Meet up with other students outside of class. Create a small study group to review the course material and work together. The secret to success in college is teaching yourselves how to learn new material.
- If anything is interfering with your learning, email or talk with us about it. We care about how you're doing in life, not just in our classroom.
